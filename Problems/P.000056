* Number: 56
* Problem: Packing Unit Squares in a Simple Polygon
* Statement:
What is the complexity of deciding whether a given number of
axis-parallel unit squares can be packed into a simple polygon (without holes)?
* Origin: Unknown.
* Status/Conjectures: Solved: proved NP-hard by Abrahamsen and Stade~\cite{as-hpcps-24}.
* Motivation: Natural packing problem.
* Partial and Related Results:
The problem is known to be NP-hard for
polygons with holes~\cite{fpt-opcpa-81}, even
if the polygon is an orthogonal polygon with
all coordinates being multiples of $1/2$.
Recently this version of the problem was shown to be
in NP \cite{deio-p2usg-09}, making it NP-complete.

The problem is the decision version for two optimization
problems of very different behavior.
There is a PTAS for packing the maximum number of squares of fixed
size~\cite{hm-ascpp-85}.  Maximizing the size of squares such that a
fixed number of squares can be packed has a lower bound on approximation
of $14/13$, and there is a $3/2$-approximation~\cite{bf-agdp-01}.

In 2024, Abrahamsen and Stade~\cite{as-hpcps-24} proved that the problem is NP-hard, even when
the polygon is an orthogonal and orthogonally convex polygon with half-integer
coordinates.
